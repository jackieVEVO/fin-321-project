FIN-321 Business Project Document Repository

Instructions said "Replace the text with the README for Students provided below," and provided nothing below. Anywho, I know how to edit a text file.

Hopefully this will suffice. 

Extra Credit Assignment – Using GitHub for Non-Development Business Document Organization
Points: 3 (extra credit)
Due: Thursday, Aug 14, 2025

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is an online platform that helps people store, manage, and track changes to files.  

It’s built on Git, a version control system that records every change you make, so you can go back to older versions, compare edits, and collaborate with others without overwriting work.

Although it’s widely used for software development, GitHub can also be a powerful tool for organizing business and academic documents.

## How GitHub Works (Basic Level)
Repositories = Your project folder (can contain any type of files: Word docs, spreadsheets, PDFs, images, etc.).

Commits = Saved changes to files, with a record of *what* changed and *when*.

Branches = Different versions of a project you can work on without affecting the main version.

Pull Requests = A way to suggest and review changes before adding them to the main version.

History = Every version is saved, so nothing is lost.

## Why GitHub is Useful for Non-Development Work
Version Control: Keep a full history of your documents so you can restore earlier versions.

Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.

Organization: Store all project files in one place with clear structure.

Access Anywhere: View and edit from any device with internet access.

Public or Private: Choose who can see your work.

## Example Use Cases for Business or Academic Projects
Storing and version-controlling project proposals, SOPs, and financial reports: Keep your important business documents organized and revert to earlier drafts if needed.

Maintaining a collaborative knowledge base for a team: Store shared FAQs, process guides, or training materials that anyone on your team can update.

Organizing research data and documentation: Keep notes, raw data, and analyses in one place with a clear change history.

Creating a central repository for templates and repeatable workflows: Store reusable templates for reports, project plans, or presentations.

## Tips
Keep your repository organized with clear folder names.

Write helpful commit messages so you remember what each change did.

Use Markdown (`.md`) files for text-based documentation—they’re lightweight, readable, and easy to edit in GitHub.
